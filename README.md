## This is sloppy code!

A great way to learn how to write clean code, is to immerse yourself in some sloppy code first!
This project focused on the usage of Javascript.  I had fun with it and kept adding code to accomplish different things as new issues surfaced.  Through the process I learned what to expect from an application, and how to plan for it.  I can see the benefit from psuedo coding a project first, to keep form falling down a rabbit hole and having to claw your way back out with code that is less than intuitive.

## What were my focuses in this project?

### Javasript Javascript Javascript

* Dynamic creation of HTML elements
* Dynamically adding attributes to elements for styling and other purposes
* Usage of local storage for data persistance
* Usage of time intervals
* Usage of event listeners
* Iterating through local storage array to dynamically append list items to DOM
* removing dynamically created elements from the DOM

## What were some of my key take aways?

As stated earlier, psuedo coding a project and spelling out what I want to accomplish is a great way to get organized before any coding begins.  Scope became a big deal too, especially in regards to event listeners.  I started out by placing event listeners inside functions so they would apply to dynamic content as it was created.  I evolved into using event delegation to target content that did not exist yet.  This helped emphasize how bubbling can be used to your advantage in the DOM.  I also ended up enclosing my timer within a function and wasn't able to access it later to stop or change the countdown time.

### Key Take aways

* Psuedo coding
* Scope 
* Event delegation/propagation
* For loops and the forEach method as an alternative (ES6)
* Using arguments to more efficiently write functions
* How to more efficiently wrote specific functons to create and append nested content dynamically

## Learn through doing

This project is still buggy!  The timer functionality is not where is should be.  The start over function is not working either.  I can apply what I learned to the next project though, and make that one better.  This project will serve as marker of my coding progression!
